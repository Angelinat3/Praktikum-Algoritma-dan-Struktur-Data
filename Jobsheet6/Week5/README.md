# JOBSHEET VI
## SORTING (BUBBLE, SELECTION, DAN INSERTION SORT)

## 6.2.1 Experiment Steps, Implementing Sorting Using Objects
SORTING – BUBBLE SORT
1. Create a new folder named week05.
2. Create a class Sorting, then add the following attributes:
3. Create a constructor with parameters data[] and jmlDat.
4. Create a bubbleSort method of type void and declare its contents using the Bubble Sort algorithm.
5. Create a print method of type void and declare the content of the method.

6. Create a class SortingMain, then declare an array named a[] and fill it.

7. Create a new object named sorting1, which is an instantiation of the Sorting class, then fill in its parameters.
8. Call the bubbleSort and print methods.

B. SORTING – SELECTION SORT
1. In the Sorting class created in the previous step, add the selectionSort method that implements sorting using the selection sort algorithm.

2. Declare an array named b[] in the SortingMain<Attendance Number> class, then fill it.

3. Create a new object named sorting2, which is an instantiation of the Sorting class, then assign in its parameters.
4. Call the selectionSort and print methods.

C. SORTING – INSERTION SORT
1. In the Sorting class created in the previous step, add the insertionSort method that implements sorting using the insertion sort algorithm.

4. Add a method add() in this class to insert student objects into the listStudents attribute.
5. Add a method print() in this class to display all students.
