# JOBSHEET V BRUTE FORCE AND DIVIDE CONQUER

## 5.2.1. Experiment Steps
1. Create a new project named BruteForceDivideConquer (or continue the previous project) and a
package called week5.
2. Create a new class, Factorial
3. Complete the Factorial class with the attributes and methods as illustrated in the class
diagram above.

## 5.2.3. Questions
1. In the base case of the Divide and Conquer algorithm for calculating factorial, explain the
differences in the code structure between the if and else conditions!


2. Is it possible to modify the loop in the factorialBF() method to use an alternative to the for
loop? Please explain and give example if needed!
