# JOBSHEET 11 
## 2.1.1. Experiment Steps

1. Create a new folder named P1Jobsheet11 or another prefered name, inside the Praktikum-ASD repository, then create a new class named Queue.
2. Add the attributes of the Queue as shown in the class diagram, then add the constructor as described below:

3. Create a boolean method named isEmpty to check whether the queue is empty.
4. Create a boolean method named isFull to check whether the queue is full.

5. Create a void method named peek to display the element at the front of the queue.

6. Create a void method named print to display all elements in the queue, from the front to the rear position.

7. Create a void method named clear to remove all elements from the queue.

8. Create a void method named enqueue to add an element to the queue, using a parameter dt of type int.

9. Create an int method named dequeue to remove and return the data from the front position of the queue.

10. Next, create a new class named QueueMain. Create a void method named menu to display and handle the program's menu options during execution.

11. Create the main method, then declare a Scanner object named sc.
12. Create a variable named n to store the user input representing the maximum number of elements that can be stored in the queue.
13. Instantiate a Queue object named Q, passing n as the queue's element capacity.

14. Declare an integer variable named choice to store the user's menu selection.
15. Use a do-while loop to keep the program running based on user input. Inside the loop, use a switch-case statement to execute queue operations according to the user's menu selection.

## 2.1.3. Question
1. In the constructor, why are the initial values of the front and rear attributes set to -1, while the
size attribute is set to 0?
2. In the Enqueue method, explain the meaning and purpose of the following code snippet!
3. In the Dequeue method, explain the meaning and purpose of the following code snippet!
